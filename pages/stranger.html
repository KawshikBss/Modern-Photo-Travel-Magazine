                        Each and every one of my friends has a
                        <br />
                        different perception of Dhaka and it is
                        <br />
                        important for everyone. Everyone is busy to
                        <br />
                        resemble how familiar Dhaka is to them.
                        <br />
                        Sometimes, history gives us goosebumps by
                        <br />making us realize that the biggest horror is
                        change and the
                        <br />
                        change that you can't
                        <br />
                        remember. In the end, thereâ€™s nothing to remember. How
                        emotional it is right? Our
                        <br />
                        own Dhaka was once full of people who
                        <br />
                        called Dhaka their own and now there is this
                        <br />
                        Dhaka which we are so proud of and one day
                        <br />neither our Dhaka will be Dhaka but an
                        <br />enchantment of the past where some <br />random
                        people will be amused that there
                        <br />
                        was someone like us. There was something
                        <br />like us. Isn't it scary? Isn't it a muse?
