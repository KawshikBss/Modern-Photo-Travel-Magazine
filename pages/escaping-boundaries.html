                Experience is a thing that I never had the chance to gather
                plenty of, if I leave my academic life aside. Between my
                monotonous family life and packed academic schedules, I never
                was fortunate enough to undergo anything Bizarre. But something
                always has to fill the gap of something. Like “The Invisible
                Cities” I, Kublai Khan, Found my Marco Polo. Let’s give my Marco
                a name, let's call him Sam.
                <br />
                I have always been the Rupanzel, in her high castle, imagining
                the world and putting colour into it with her words, with no
                permission to see it in real life. His narration of different
                places, things and experiences, ignited my blank pages of
                experience. I learned to see the city of Dhaka from a totally
                new perspective, a way I never perceived or could ever perceive
                Dhaka. I could decorate my own tapestry of Dhaka with his
                strokes of experience and the colours of my imaginations. Who
                knew, just walking down a road can give you so many stories ? so
                many lenses to see things ? I learned to sense my vicinity
                through the chronicles of Sam. The best storyteller of my life.
                This person has this enchanting capability of turning everything
                into a story, mixing it up with imagination and surreal imagery.
                <br />
                I lived a multidimensional life through his stories. I’ve been
                to the beach and mountains at the same time, I’ve discovered
                myself as a bus driver riding to Italy, I found him fighting the
                crocodiles while I stood and screamed. We’ve been on a quest to
                find an island and declare it as a kingdom. The faint yellow
                night light of my congested room in a concrete jungle, used to
                turn into the magic carpet of Aladdin, and we used to fly
                through a million cities, that too through the tiny screen of
                our cellphones.
                <br />
                I remember the cheap bar of Italy, how we pretended to drink and
                laughed at each other's stupidity, I remember slow dancing on
                top of the London Bridge, climbing Everest, driving through a
                road full of foxes hanging from the tree branches, upside down.
                I still remember the day we went to Manila to eat ice cream,
                because it rhymes with vanilla. I didn’t even have my passport
                at that time. Also, the dark old zamindars palace, just to fish
                treasure from their ancient creepy pond. He forced me to dive to
                the bottom of the pond and find the box full of gold. I cannot
                even swim in real life. We even turned into trees the other day,
                me a mango tree and he, an innocent little jackfruit tree while
                we had a meaningful conversation from the perspective of trees.
                <br />
                Words are so powerful that just a conversation could create
                worlds, build cities, and make us travel the world within
                seconds. I haven’t been anywhere in the world other than the
                overcrowded, sleepless cities of Dhaka and Narayanganj. Yet,
                through our imaginations, I’ve been everywhere, I’ve my
                footprints all over the world. We made memories in places we’ve
                never been, the memories we can’t even say are not real.
